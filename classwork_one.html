    <h1>Hello my name is Abdullah Wafy</h1>

    <p>During my last summer vacation (2021), we were mainly focused on moving out of state. We moved from California to
        Texas, driving through Arizon and New Mexico. It was very hectic yet an intensive enjoyable experience. We were
        working non-stop from morning to night, going to sleep exhausted. We saw wonderful sights along the long drive
        and arrived to our destination a day before work started. Without Allah the trip was practically impossible, but
        when Allah arranges your affairs then everything is facilited in almost mysterious ways.</p>

            alt="Rainbow seen from rental truck while driving and entering through Texas border" width="600"
            height="600" />

    <p>My favorite activies in life are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>reading to learn useful knowledge</li>
        <li>worshipping and meditating (i.e. practicing and applying that knowledge) for self-improvement</li>
        <li>teaching the knowledge I've learnt to benefit others to enhance the quality of life on earth</li>
    </ul>
